colMapper-py
============

Whoa! I'm overhauling the internals right now.
Get back to you on how it works, later.

colMapper provides column mapping controls for Office Spreadsheet applications (MS Excel, LibreOffice-Calc, etc).
This name is misleading now because it can do row mapping, column mapping, and (eventually) sub-mapping.
Therefore, this will be later renamed.
Maybe to `xlmp`, but I don't want to imply association with anyone working on `xlrd`, `xlwt` or `xlutils`.

## Dependencies

- Python [xlrd module](https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd)
- Python [xlwt module](https://github.com/python-excel/xlwt)
- Python 2.3 - 2.7 (As needed by above)
